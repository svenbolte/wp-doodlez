## Description ##

### WPDoodlez
plan and vote to find a common appointment date with participiants for an event. Works similar to famous Doodle(TM) website.
It adds a custom post type "wpdoodlez".

You can just use the custom posts for polls and appointments or place the poll in an existing post or page using the shortcode:

Shortcode: ´´´[wpdoodlez_sc id=post-ID chart=true]´´´
 set post ID to integrate Doodlez or Poll in other pages, set chart to false if you do not want pie graph
 set chart to fals to omit showing cake chart (requires chartscodes plugin)

 Notice: You may use this shortcode only once per page or post.

### Poll
uses same technology and custom post type like WPDoodlez
create classic polls to let visitors vote about a question

Shortcode: ´´´[wpdoodlez_stats id=22817 type=poll|doodlez]´´´ show stats of all polls or doodlez in a list on a page or post
	id = 0  // or omit id parameter - shows stats of all polls and appointments, set other id to specify the output
	type = poll (or empty, default) displays all poll results // or type = doodlez display all doodlez results

### Quizzz
Play a quiz game with one or four answers
Quizzz supports categories images and integrates them in single and header if used in theme.
It adds a custom post type "question". See readme.txt for more details.
If you place pictures in upload/quizbilder folder and enter the filename of the picture you can make questions displaying the picture

Add Shortcode ´´´[random-question]´´´ to an html widget (only on front page)

#### Crossword
You can add a random crossword game to your pages and posts or call the crossword game from the random quizzz widget.
16 random words and questions will be chosen and put into a crossword game. Admin can display the solutions, users can see vocals as hints.

	== Crossword Usage == call any quiz page with url parameter crossord=1 or call from the menu during a quiz or on random question widget.

## Why this fork?
the main project was not updated for years now. I needed some features and added them to the project.
Completed the german and german formal translations. Added method to use structure for polls (only one answer allowed)
Added quiz custom post type "question" to make a 4 answers and single answer quiz with results certificate. questions can be played as hangman, when answer ist suitable

## GDPR (DSGVO) notice
Participiants do net need to enter their full name (a nick name would do).
A cookie "wpdoodlez-hashofthevote" with the given nic name is stored on the local computer to
notice that one has voted already - so you should opt-in cookies and place a note on your GDPR statement.

If Using penguin-mod theme cookies will only be set after visitor allows comfort cookies (stated by hidecookiebannerx=2 cookie-setting).

WPDoodlez (posts or posts with wpd shortcode) can be password protected (with builtin wordpress logic) to prevent others seeing the content
Archives, Post Content, Post-Thumbnail, Categories and Tags have been enabled to provide full integration like a normal post.

Quizzz game has a shortcode for random questions and a custom post type "question" for quiz. It can display a certificate to print
and stores your ranking in a personal cookie. personal rankings are only stored in your browser, not the web server and only if you allow comfort cookies


## Details for the plugin

WPDoodlez can handle classic polls and doodle like appointment planning
If custom fields are named vote1...vote10, a poll is created, just displaying the vote summaries if custom fields are dates e.g name: 12.12.2020 value: ja
then a doodlez is created where visitors can set their name or shortcut and vote for all given event dates
User parameter /admin=1 to display alternate votes display (more features when logged in as admin)

Highlights
* link to WPdoodlez is public, but post can have password
* A WPdoodlez can be in a review and be published at given time
* A WPdoodlez can have own URL
* Poll users do not need to be valid logged in wordpress users
* Users with "delete published post" rights can delete votes
* Users shortname will be stored in a cookie for 30 days (user can change only his own vote, but on the same computer)
* Every custom field set in a WPdoodle is a possible answer
* The first value of the custom field will be displayed in the row as users answer
* The last row in the table contains total votes count
* shortcodes for poll stats and to embed a poll in any page or post or html widget

To upload the plugin through WordPress, instead of FTP:
1. Upload the downloaded zip file on the 'Add New' plugins screen (see the 'Upload' tab) in your WordPress admin area and activate.
2. Goto Wordpress admin panel, settings, permalinks and update permalink structure!

##  ------------------------------- Quizzz Module and shortcode -----------------------------  ##

Create a sequential quiz on WordPress with the Quizzz plugin. Use a shortcode random_question to display in posts/pages
You can create rich questions, with rich text, images, videos, audio, as you would in any other WordPress post, and let the user answer in plain text, and move on to the next question if they have answered correctly.
The answer conditions can be either 'exact match & case-sensitive', or can be phrase-matched (eg. the list of correct answers can be "xyz, abc, def", and if the user enters "abc", it's counted as the right answer.

### How to import questions in csv format: ###

Create a csv file with the following structure:
	// id; datum; charakter; land; titel; seitjahr; antwort; antwortb; antwortc; antwortd; zusatzinfo; kategorie
name the file "public_hist_quizfrage.csv" asnd upload it into your wordpress upload directory like: /wp-content/uploads
	Goto admin areas, open questions list and press the CSV Import Button on top
	present questions WILL BE DELETED and csv content imported as custom post type question
	You may assign a categories images category image if using the plugin. It will show the cpt category image
	Sample images are in the plugin subfolder quizkatbilder
If you name the file "public_hist_quizfrage_update.csv"	 questions in file will be added
Use the shortcode or link to custom post type "question" do display questions

The plugin also raises the following hooks:
quizz_level_updated: raised when the user's answer is considered correct and they're pushed to the next question
quizz_ended: raised when the list of questions comes to an end, and the user is sent to a designated page (eg. a congratulations page)

== Quiz Usage ==
1. Under Questions in the WordPress admin menu, click on Add New Question. 
2. Enter the question in the big post area. This can be plain text, images, or embedded multimedia. 
3. Enter the correct answer in the Answer field below the question field.
4. Choose whether you will accept only exact matches, or a part answer (eg. you enter a series of answers delimited by commas) is valid.
5. Select which question leads to the current question.
6. Select whether this is the final question of the series, and if it is, choose the Page which will be displayed when the player is done with the quiz. Eg. a thank you page, or a success page.
